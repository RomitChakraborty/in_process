Voice React Agent Fork
Overview
This repository is a fork of the Voice React Agent published by LangChain. It introduces asynchronous iterators for processing both text and audio streams.

Project Status
This fork is currently in progress. The goal is to build a Siri-like interface capable of running quantum chemistry computations. However, we quickly realized that relying on Voice React alone is insufficient. A multimodal approach is necessary for the interface to function effectively.

Integration with Meta-Lowdin
We plan to merge this project with Meta-Lowdin, an agent leveraging the Whisper model. A functional interface for Meta-Lowdin has already been tested and will be versioned in a separate Git repository on February 27, 2025.

Notes & Next Steps
Multimodality: Critical for handling audio, text, and additional input/output formats needed for quantum chemistry.
Asynchronous Iterators: Provide efficient text and audio processing without blocking.
Future Merging: The merged solution will incorporate both Voice React functionality and Meta-Lowdinâ€™s Whisper-based features.
Stay tuned for updates as the development continues!
