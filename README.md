## In process

# This work is a fork of the voice react agent published by langchain.
# This uses asynchronous iterators for processing text and audio

## Running Notes - Feb 27th, 2025

# When I pursued the implementing a Siri-like interface for running quantum chemistry code, I juickly realised that voice-react by itself is inadequate.
# Multimodality is essential to make the interface functional.
# This project will be merged with Meta-Lowdin, the agent that implements works through the whisper model.
# Functional interface for Meta-Lowdin has been tested, and will be versioned in separate git repo on Feb 27th, 2025.
